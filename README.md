- [✨ &nbsp;Changelog](https://github.com/danielroe/nuxt-full-static/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- [▶️ &nbsp;Online playground](https://stackblitz.com/github/danielroe/nuxt-full-static/tree/main/playground)

## Features

**⚠️ `nuxt-full-static` is a proof of concept. ⚠️**

👉 Roadmap and progress for nuxt 3 payload extraction support: [nuxt/framework#6411](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/issues/6411)

- Generates static payloads at build time if routes are prerendered
- Also works in hybrid mode, rendering payloads on the server

## Usage

```js
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-full-static'],
})
```

Automatically, all your `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` calls will be _prefilled_ with static payloads. As long as you haven't set `initialCache` or `server` to false, you should not see these functions running on client-side at all. You can even stub them out by prefixing them with `process.server &&`:

```js
const { data } = useAsyncData(() => process.server && $fetch('https://my.api.com/data'))
```

_However_, you also retain the ability to opt-out, by manually calling `refresh`. This will result in running the data fetching function again.

## 💻 Development

- Clone this repository
- Enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) using `corepack enable`
- Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
- Stub module with `pnpm dev:prepare`
- Run `pnpm dev` to start [playground](./playground) in development mode
